This is a fork of Rojo with changes specific to the workflow at Uplift Games.

## If you are looking for syncback, check out [releases](https://github.com/UpliftGames/rojo/releases). If you're looking for its source, look at [`syncback-merge`](https://github.com/UpliftGames/rojo/tree/syncback-merge). If you're looking for the legacy fork we had that is being replaced, check out below:

Changes from upstream Rojo:
* TOML support
* Ability to define the type of a file using glob patterns
* Font property support
* Model Scale property support
* Adds Font and Gui Inset migrations
* MeshPart support
* UniqueId support

<details><summary>Release Instructions</summary>

New Uplift Games-specific releases should:
* Be created via [workflow dispatch on the Release action](https://github.com/UpliftGames/rojo/actions/workflows/release.yml)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1669436/233771073-ccbd1834-3341-4aeb-91cd-be7b02878b39.png)
  * Be created on the `uplift` branch _(this is our `main`)_
  * Be tagged with an appropriate semver **plus** a pre-release tag in the following format:\
    `v1.2.3-uplift.1`\
    ...where `v1.2.3` is the semver and `uplift.1` increments for each release we make.
    It is acceptable to maintain the release count across semver changes.
  * Once the release action finishes there will be a release draft. Add a changelog and publish it.
    If any release job fails due to aftman github limits, re-run failed jobs.
* Add our changes to `CHANGELOG.md`. If we rebase on a
  new version of Rojo that includes some of our additions, we should list only
  what has changed between upstream Rojo and our fork.
* Where possible, our changes should become PRs to the upstream Rojo repo. When
  we do this, we should include a link to the PR in the changelog entry.
